# The Hundred Tree project

Application designed to solve the following problem:

Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.

Run it with Python using the Pyramid Framework 

The app package does all the logic job.
